**Swiftagram** is a client for [**Instagram**](https://instagram.com) written entirely in **Swift**.\
<br/>

> How does it work?  

**Swiftagram** relies on Instagram unofficial private APIs, used internally in the Android and iOS apps.  

This is because Instagram's **oficial APIs**, both the [**Instagram Basic Display API**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api) and the [**Instagram Graph API**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/), are either lacking support for even the most mundane of features or limited to a small audience (e.g. _Professional_, i.e. _Creator_ and _Influencer_, accounts).  

> Do I need an API token?

**Swiftagram** requires no token or registration.\
Unofficial APIs, though, are not authorized by Instagram for external use: use them at your own risk.

> Where can I use this?

**Swiftagram** supports **iOS**, **macOS**, **watchOS**, **tvOS** and **Linux**.

#### **Swiftagram** is currently under development and more features are expected to be implemented everyday, which might result in breaking changes.

## Installation
#### Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11 and above)
1. Select `File`/`Swift Packages`/`Add Package Dependencyâ€¦` from the menu.
1. Paste `https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram.git`.
1. Follow the steps.

**Swiftagram** depends on [KeychainSwift](https://github.com/evgenyneu/keychain-swift) and requires Swift 5.0 or above.

## Usage
Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki) to learn about use cases.  

### Authentication
Authentication is provided through conformance to the [`Authenticator`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/Authenticator) protocol.  

The library comes with a concrete implementation allowing access with _username_ and _password_, named [`BasicAuthenticator`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/BasicAuthenticator).  
Future versions are expected to also provide a web view based `Authenticator`.

### Caching
Caching of [`Secret`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/Authentication_Response)s is provided through conformance to the [`Storage`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/Storage) protocol.  

The library comes with several concrete implementations.  
- [`TransientStorage`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/TransientStorage) should be used when no caching is necessary.  
- [`UserDefaultsStorage`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/UserDefaultsStorage) allows for faster, out-of-the-box, testing, although it's not recommended for production as private cookies are not encoded.  
- [`KeychainStorage`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/KeychainStorage) (**preferred**) stores them safely in the user's keychain.
