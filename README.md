**Swiftagram** is a client for [**Instagram**](https://instagram.com) written entirely in **Swift**.

<br/>

> How does it work?  

**Swiftagram** relies on Instagram unofficial private APIs, used internally in the Android and iOS apps.  

This is because Instagram's **oficial APIs**, both the [**Instagram Basic Display API**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api) and the [**Instagram Graph API**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/), are either lacking support for even the most mundane of features or limited to a small audience (e.g. _Professional_, i.e. _Creator_ and _Influencer_, accounts).  

> Do I need an API token?

**Swiftagram** requires no token or registration.\
Unofficial APIs, though, are not authorized by Instagram for external use: use them at your own risk.

> Where can I use this?

**Swiftagram** supports **iOS**, **macOS**, **watchOS**, **tvOS** and **Linux**.

**Swiftagram is currently under active development and more features are expected to be implemented everyday, which might result in breaking changes.**

> What's next?

- **Pagination support**:\
Bypass setting `max_id` manually after every [`Request`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/Request).  

- **Improve code coverage**:\
Finish writing tests for **Swiftagram** sources.

## Installation
### Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11 and above)
1. Select `File`/`Swift Packages`/`Add Package Dependencyâ€¦` from the menu.
1. Paste `https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram.git`.
1. Follow the steps.

**Swiftagram** requires **Swift 5.0** or above.\
**SwiftagramKeychain**, an optional library for storing [`Secret`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/Secret)s directly into the keychain, depends on [**KeychainSwift**](https://github.com/evgenyneu/keychain-swift).

`Request` also defines custom [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher)s when linking against the [**Combine**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) framework.

> Why not CocoaPods, or Carthage, or ~blank~?

Supporting multiple _dependency managers_ makes maintaining a library exponentially more complicated and time consuming.\
Furthermore, with the intregration of the **Swift Package Manager** in **Xcode 11** and greater, we expect the need for alternative solutions to fade quickly.

## Usage
Check out our [Examples](Examples) or visit the (_auto-generated_) [Wiki](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki) to learn about use cases.  

### Authentication
Authentication is provided through conformance to the [`Authenticator`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/Authenticator) protocol, which, on success, returns a `Secret` containing all the cookies needed to sign a `Request`.

The library comes with two concrete implementations.
- [`BasicAuthenticator`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/BasicAuthenticator) requires _username_ and _password_, and includes support for checkpoints and two factor authentication.
- [`WebViewAuthenticator`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/WebViewAuthenticator), available for **iOS 11**+ and **macOS 10.13**+, relying on a `WKWebView` for fetching cookies.

### Caching
Caching of `Secret`s is provided through conformance to the [`Storage`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/Storage) protocol.  

The library comes with several concrete implementations.  
- [`TransientStorage`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/TransientStorage) should be used when no caching is necessary.  
- [`UserDefaultsStorage`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/UserDefaultsStorage) allows for faster, out-of-the-box, testing, although it's not recommended for production as private cookies are not encoded.  
- [`KeychainStorage`](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram/wiki/KeychainStorage), part of **SwiftagramKeychain**, (**preferred**) stores them safely in the user's keychain.
