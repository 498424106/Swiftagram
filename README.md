**Instagram** offers two kinds of APIs to developers. The **Instagram Basic Display API** (extremely limited in functionality), and the **Instagram Graph API** for _Professional_, i.e. _Business_ and _Creator_, accounts only.

However, Instagram apps rely on a third type of API, the so-called Private API or Unofficial API, and **Swiftagram** is an iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS client for them, written entirely in Swift. You can try and create a better Instagram experience for your users, or write bots for automating different tasks.

These Private API require no token or app registration but they're not authorized by Instagram for external use.  
Use this at your own risk.
